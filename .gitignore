# Note: secret.key is purposefully not tracked by git. This should be backed up
# separately because configs may contain secrets which were encrypted using the
# secret.key.  To back up secrets use 'tar -czf /tmp/secrets.tgz secret*' and
# save the file separate from your repository.  If you want secrets backed up
# with configuration, then see the bottom of this file for an example.

# Ignore all JENKINS_HOME except jobs directory, root xml config, and
# .gitignore file.

# For performance reasons, we want to ignore builds in Jenkins jobs because it
# contains many tiny files on large installations.  This can impact git
# performance when running even basic commands like 'git status'.

# Security warning: If secrets are included with your configuration, then an
# adversary will be able to decrypt all encrypted secrets within Jenkins
# config.  Including secrets is a bad practice, but the example is included in
# case someone still wants it for convenience.  Uncomment the following line to
# include secrets for decryption with repository configuration in Git.

# As a result, only Jenkins settings and job config.xml files in JENKINS_HOME
# will be tracked by git.
